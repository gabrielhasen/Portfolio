## Personal Projects
### [Island Generation](https://github.com/gabrielhasen/Portfolio/tree/master/(Personal)%20Unity%20Concept%20Projects/(Finished)%20Random%20World%20Generation%20Tiles)
This is a project using C# and Unity in order to generate continents / islands with Perlin noise that all consist of tiles that all individually hold their own information.  More can be found out about this project [HERE](https://github.com/gabrielhasen/Portfolio/tree/master/(Personal)%20Unity%20Concept%20Projects/(Finished)%20Random%20World%20Generation%20Tiles).

Below is the process of using using multiple noise maps to go over a base noise map in passes in order to achieve the continents / islands look that was intended.

### [Tile Town](https://github.com/gabrielhasen/Portfolio/tree/master/(Personal)%20Unity%20Concept%20Projects/(Prototype_Unfinished)%20Tile_TownGame)
This is a project using C# and Unity and its intention was to make a game board full of randomly generated tiles that all individually hold information to them.  Each game board is different as it randomly generates a main river, small ponds, a purple enemy tile, and forest tiles for the game board.  Each tile would communicate to a singleton called 'Game Manager' to convert the individual tiles information into a game about managing a city.

The city management aspect never was finished, as it wasn't very interesting.  This tile system, however, was repurposed to be used for the Island Generation project above.
