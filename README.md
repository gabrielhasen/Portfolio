## [Island Generation](https://github.com/gabrielhasen/Portfolio/tree/master/(Personal)%20Unity%20Concept%20Projects/(Finished)%20Random%20World%20Generation%20Tiles)
This is a project using C# and Unity in order to generate continents / islands with Perlin noise that all consist of tiles that all individually hold their own information.  More can be found out about this project [HERE](https://github.com/gabrielhasen/Portfolio/tree/master/(Personal)%20Unity%20Concept%20Projects/(Finished)%20Random%20World%20Generation%20Tiles).

Below is the process of using using multiple noise maps to go over a base noise map in passes in order to achieve the continents / islands look that was intended.
